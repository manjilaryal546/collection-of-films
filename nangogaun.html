                    <p id="plot">“Nango Gaun” is a gripping tale that sheds light on the relentless battle between corruption and honor, set against the picturesque backdrop of a small Nepali village. Jari Lama (Shishir Bangdel) has been blazing as a corrupt politician in a small village in Kavre for years. The locals are fed up with the politician’s current social standing and dominating manner. To put a stop to Jari’s political career, the villagers push Pasang (Dayahang Rai), a trustworthy and dedicated schoolteacher in the village, to enter politics and bring about change. Politics is not an ordinary subject for Pasang, and as a result, he prefers not to be a part of it. However, with the backing of the locals and the political establishment, he enrolls to make as many amendments as he can.
